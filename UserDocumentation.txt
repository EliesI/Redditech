First, you need to go to the 'ZOUGATAGA' application. 
You will be able to access a neutral newsfeed or the option page 
(Which allows you to choose the language of the application, you can choose between English, French, and Spanish), Allow adult content, 
set one's account to private (preventing other users from subscribing to their account), or private messages, and finally, allow NSFW content.
You will have the opportunity to log in via a button in the top left corner. 
An alert will appear to redirect you to the login page on Reddit's site. 
Once you have filled out the login form with valid credentials, you can return to our application. 
Now that you're logged in, you have access to a personalized newsfeed based on your subscriptions. 
You also have access to all the information in your profile (profile picture, banner, username, description), along with the visuals on your Reddit posts.
In the newsfeed, you will have the ability to search for posts using the search bar below the logo, as well as to filter them whether it's by HOT trend 
(posts with the most interaction in the last 24 hours), by novelty, or by TOP trends (posts of all time).
You can now navigate on the application! :)
